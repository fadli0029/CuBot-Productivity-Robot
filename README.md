# CuBot-Productivity-Robot

This is a mini and cute robot, called CuBot, which give motivation to users to be more productive. It reads screen time data of apps like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and etc, through our java app, and then sends this data to CuBot hardware system. It has 4 different reactions, each emitting different lights and sounds like the famous R2D2 robot, and it also rotates 45 degree accordingly - all of this is determined by the screen time data of the apps mentioned, and hence your productivity.

The electronic components are as follows:

Electronics
1. Arduino MEGA board (1)
2. Jumper Wires (> 20)
3. Speaker (1)
4. Servor motor - 20kg (1)
5. RGB's 
6. Breadboards 
7. Bluetooth Module HC-05

**This project was also part of the UC San Diego IEEE Quarterly Project Competition, where participants worked with students from different majors of the STEM industry.**
**Navigate to the documentation pdf file if you're interested in reading through the whole idea of the project and its purpose**


***HOW-TO-USE:***
If you have all the electronics component and have put them together, upload the arduino code to the arduino. Then download the source code for the java app, run it from your phone using arduino studio, and then connect your phone to the Bluetooth of the CuBot.
